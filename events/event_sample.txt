# How to add a new event

1. Create a new folder under `media/events/` (e.g., `media/events/charity_walk_2025`).
2. Add images (jpg, png, etc.) to this folder.
3. The event will appear automatically on the Events page.

You can also add a text file (e.g., `description.txt`) in the event folder for future enhancements.
